// PROBLEM:
// A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

// Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
// If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

// You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be 
// strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the arr.


// APPROACH:
// Suppose we have only one peak in the arr. So, the graph will be somewhat increasing and then decreasing.
// We calculated mid and it is greater than mid-1, that means we are on increasing slope and peak is on right.
// Else,we are on decreasing slope and peak is on the left.
// Now, if we have multiple peaks, then even if we discard left or right portion of the mid, we'll definitely
// get a peak on the other portion of the mid.
